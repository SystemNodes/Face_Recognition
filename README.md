# **Face Recognition Project**
## **Overview**
This project aims to develop a face recognition system using machine learning techniques. The system will be able to detect and recognize faces in images or videos, allowing for applications such as identity verification, access control, and personalized experiences.

## **Features**
- Face detection: The system will be able to detect faces in images or videos using computer vision algorithms.
- Face recognition: Once a face is detected, the system will compare it against a database of known faces to recognize the person.
- Identification: The system will be able to identify individuals by matching their face against a database of known faces.
- Verification: The system will be able to verify if a person's face matches a specific individual from the database.
- Real-time processing: The system will be optimized to perform face recognition in real-time, allowing for applications in live video streams.

## **Technologies Used**
- Python: The project will be implemented using Python programming language.
- OpenCV: OpenCV library will be used for face detection and image processing.
- Deep learning frameworks: Deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch will be used for training and deploying the face recognition model.

## **Usage**
- Start the application by running the main.py script.
- Capture or import an image or video for face recognition.
- The system will detect and recognize faces in the provided input.
- The recognized faces will be displayed along with their corresponding identities or labels.
